# Arabic Sentiment Analysis Model - README

This repository contains a sentiment analysis model based on the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model is designed to classify text data into sentiment categories using the AraBERT model. The model was trained on the ArSAS dataset and utilizes the architecture.

## Model Overview

- **Model Name**: aubmindlab/bert-base-arabertv02-twitter
- **Dataset**: ArSAS
- **Model Architecture**: BERT
- **Training Time**: [Specify if relevant]
- **Performance Metrics**: Macro F1 Score, Accuracy

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file or by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

Before using the model, set up your environment by installing the necessary dependencies. Run the following commands:


pip install -r requirements.txt

###  2. Running the Model
To use the model for sentiment analysis, follow these steps:

-Initialize the model with the model_init() function.

-Train the model using the trainer.train() method.

-Save the trained model and tokenizer to an output directory.

### 3. Inference
You can perform sentiment analysis using the saved model:
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="output_dir", device=0, return_all_scores=True)
result = pipe("Your input text goes here.")
print(result)

Replace "Your input text goes here." with the text you want to analyze for sentiment.
